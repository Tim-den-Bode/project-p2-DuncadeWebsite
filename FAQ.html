  <button class="accordion">what is the idea behind the art style of the game?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Duncade is fully made with the limitations in mind of the older machines. But instead of restricting itself to
      it, it is used as a guideline to make a refined game.
      Shading on the sprites? It uses the color limitations of those machines as a base but is then refined to make it
      better yet close to its origin.</p>
