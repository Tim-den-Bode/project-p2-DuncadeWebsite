                            Duncade is the perfect game for when you want to go back to the golden time of arcades but
                            this time a little modernized and made for personal use. Go through your adventure as the
                            nameless knight who has an addiction to points, who can't rest until you get to the end to
                            brag about his "HIGHSCORE" all over the world. (This is how you do lore right?)

                            You would get bored playing the same game over and over again after a while. It works for
                            the masses, but you want to have the best experience for yourself. No need to get bored
                            anymore! After dying, your score will turn into a currency used as a way to unlock new
                            items, spells, outfits, and a gallery full of everything in the game! Ever wondered how many
                            slimes you've destroyed over all those coins you put into the machine? Time for...

                            Names of everything (It may sound stupid but they're actually really thought out).
                            Kill count on every monster (and the knight).
                            A description of every item, spell, outfit, enemy, and boss.

                            Duncade is fully made with the limitations in mind of the older machines. But instead of
                            restricting itself to it, it is used as a guideline to make a refined game. Shading on the
                            sprites? It uses the color limitations of those machines as a base but is then refined to
                            make it better yet close to its origin.
